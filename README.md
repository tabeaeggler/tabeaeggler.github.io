# dataViz-cost-of-living

In this project, I explore the rising cost of living in London and its impact on the city's residents through various visualization techniques, creating an interactive and informative data story. The visualizations address several research questions related to the cost of living, inflation, and the financial situation of Londoners.

- Interactive and responsive visualizations developed using D3.js
- Data pre-processing with Python
- Presentation of data from multiple sources, such as the Greater London Authority and the Office for National Statistics
